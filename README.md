[![camefrom](/babo.png)](https://twitter.com/suckzo_o/status/955653573496356864)

사진을 클릭하면 원본 트윗을 볼 수 있을 것 같습니다.

문서의 키워드들은 [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt)를 따릅니다.

## HowTo

라이센스 파일은 라이센스 복사해서 자기 이름 넣으시면 됩니다. 프로그램은 "나는 빡빡이다"를 출력하되 **사용자가 눈치재기 좋은 위치에 볼 수 있을 정도의 시간 동안** 출력해야 합니다.

## [Usage](/Usages.md)

빡빡이 라이센스를 사용하는 리포들입니다. 만약 빡빡이 라이센스를 사용하신다면 직접 풀리퀘 날려주세요.
